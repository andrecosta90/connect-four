# Connect Four

This is a simple implementation of the [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game in Ruby.

## Clone the repo

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/andrecosta90/connect-four.git
   cd connect-four
```

## How to Run

To play the game, make sure you have Ruby installed on your system. Then, navigate to the directory `connect-four` and run the following command:

```bash
ruby lib/main.rb
```

## How to Play
1. The game starts with an empty 6x7 board.
1. Two players take turns dropping their respective symbols into one of the columns (from 1 to 7).
1. The first player to get **four** of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
1. If all spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

Enjoy the game!
